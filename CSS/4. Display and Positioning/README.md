## Flow of HTML
A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML.

In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

In this lesson, you will learn five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the browser:
- position
- display
- z-index
- float
- clear
Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.
