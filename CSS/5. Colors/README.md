## Foreground vs Background
Before discussing the specifics of color, it’s important to make two distinctions about color. Color can affect the following design aspects:

- The foreground color
- The background color
Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading has been styled.

Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled.
