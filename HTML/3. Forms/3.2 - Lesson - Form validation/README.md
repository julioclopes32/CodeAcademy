# 3.2 Lesson - Form validation
Validation is the concept of checking user provided data against the required data.

There are different types of validation. One type is server-side validation, this happens when data is sent to another machine (typically a server) for validation. An example of this type of validation is the usage of a login page. The form on the login page accepts username and password input, then sends the data to a server that checks that the pair matches up correctly.

On the other hand, we use client-side validation if we want to check the data on the browser (the client). This validation occurs before data is sent to the server. Different browsers implement client-side validation differently, but it leads to the same outcome.
