# 3.2 - Project - Birthday Party
In this project, you’ll be using Git to make a 1-page website for your friend Kay’s birthday party.

## Birthday Party

1. From the terminal, list the Git branches.

2. Kay wasn’t sure where she wanted to host the party, so you made several Git branches to explore different locations.

Some of the branches are no longer needed. Delete the following branches:
```
moma
whitney 
```
You’ll need the ```-D``` option, because these feature branches were never merged into ```master```:
```
git branch -D branchname
```

3. Kay wants to see a version of the webpage that includes an unordered list with bullet points instead of a paragraph to show information about the party.

Create a new branch called ```unordered-list``` and switch over to it.

4. In **index.html**.html, replace:
```
<p>Description: Join Kay in celebrating their 29th birthday with free food and beverages, karaoke and a special appearance by Willy Nelson. Also, feel free to explore the Met museum before or after you stop by! Presents for Kay optional.</p>
```
with this unordered list:
```
<ul>
    <li>Join Kay in celebrating their 29th birthday with free food and beverages</li>
    <li>karaoke and a special appearance by Willy Nelson</li>
    <li>explore the Met museum before or after you stop by!</li>
    <li>Birthday presents optional</li>
</ul>
```
Click Save.

5. Add **index.html**.html to the staging area.

6. Now make a commit.

7. Kay approves the changes you made in the ```unordered-list``` branch.

Switch over to ```master```. Then, merge ```unordered-list``` into ```master```. This will be a fast forward merge.

8. Kay wants the heading to be way bigger. Create a new branch called ```big-heading```.

9. Now, switch over the ```big-heading``` branch.

To make the heading bigger, replace the line below:
```
<h1>Kay's Birthday Party</h1>
```
With this line:
```
<h1 style="font-size: 72px">Kay's Birthday Party</h1>
```
Then click Save.

10. Add **index.html**.html to the staging area.

11. Make a commit.

12. Kay approves of the giant heading!

Switch back over to the ```master``` branch. Then, merge ```big-heading``` into ```master```.
