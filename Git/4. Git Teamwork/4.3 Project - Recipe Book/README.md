# 4.3 - Project - Recipe Book
In this project, you’ll be playing the role of two collaborators working on a recipe book.

## Recipe Book

1. Go into the **veggie-favorites** remote by using the ```cd``` command:
```
cd veggie-favorites
```
2. Once inside **veggie-favorites** make a change to **chili.txt** and/or **squash-lasagna.txt** in the code editor.

Click Save, add your changes to the Git staging area, and then make a commit.

3. Go into your clone with:
```
cd ../veggie-clone
```

4. Fetch all new work from the remote.

5. Merge origin/master into your local master branch .

6. Create a new branch, then switch over to it to work on new-recipe.txt. The recipe can be whatever dish you’d like.
Click Save.

7. Add your file changes to the staging area and make a commit.

8. Fetch one more time just for good measure (there won’t be a change).

9. Push your branch up to the remote.

10. Navigate back to the remote with:
```
cd ../veggie-favorites
```
Confirm the presence of your new Git branch there.
