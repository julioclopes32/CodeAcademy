# 3.3 - Project - Ruby Time Calculator
In this project, you’ll have to resolve merge conflicts in two markdown files. Markdown is a file format that converts easily into HTML. You won’t have to write any markdown, just identify the differences between lines.

## Ruby Time Calculator

1. You are currently on ```master```.

Merge the ```edits``` branch into the ```master``` branch.

This will create two merge conflicts: **README.md** and examples.md.

2. Using the file navigator, open **README.md** and examples.md. Identify the merge conflicts.

3. In **README.md**, keep the file changes from the ```edits``` branch. Delete the file changes from ```HEAD```.

Don’t forget to delete all of Git’s special markings that indicate a merge conflict.
Click Save.

4. Add **README.md** to the staging area.

5. Follow the same order of actions as above for examples.md: keep the ```edits``` branch file changes and delete the ```HEAD``` changes.
Click Save.

6. Add examples.md to the staging area and make a commit. Your commit message could be “Resolve merge conflict”.

7. Delete the ```edits``` branch.
