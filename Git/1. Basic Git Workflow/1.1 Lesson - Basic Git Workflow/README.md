# 1.1 Lesson - Basic Git Workflow
An introduction to Git and a few of its core features

## git init
We do this with:
```Git
git init
```
The word init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.

## git status
As you write the screenplay, you will be changing the contents of the working directory. You can check the status of those changes with:
```Git
git status
```

## git add
In order for Git to start tracking files, the file needs to be added to the staging area.

We can add a file to the staging area with:
```Git
git status
```
